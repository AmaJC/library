## Chapter 1 - The Uncomfortable Truth
* The Uncomfortable Truth of Life - one day everyone you love will die, and beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will matter
* We care and look for meaning and a sense of importance to avoid being crushed by the material insignificance of our existence
* Hope is our psyche's mental fuel - without hope of a better future, why live?
* The opposite of happiness is NOT anger or sadness - that means you still give a fuck about something. The opposite of happiness is hopelessness - resignation, indifference, "the belief that everything is fucked so why do anything at all" (pg. 16)
* Anxiety, depression, mental issues - the root cause is rooted in hopelessness
* The avoidance of hopelessness, or the construction of hope, is our mind's primary focus
> "Hope narratives are what give our lives a sense of purpose" (pg. 18)
* Religion shields us from the Uncomfortable Truth, much less suicide and depression rates among those of faith
* This book is an argument against nihilism, to build a case for hope

The Paradox of Progress
* Materially, the modern world is better than it has ever been, yet the Paradox of Progress is that we feel more anxious, desperate, and hopeless the better things get
* Progress has continued uninterrupted throughout history (e.g. literacy, education, reduced violence, racism, sexism, poverty, diseases, wars, etc)
* US is on an upswing of depression, among adults and younger people
  * Feelings of loneliness and social isolation are up
> "we are the safest and most prosperous humans in the history of the world, yet we are feeling more hopeless than ever before." (pg. 21)
  * Statistics about the past don't inspire hope, hope is based on the future
  * Hope doesn't care about problems that have already been solved. hope is only concerned about what needs to be solved

To build and maintain hope, we need:
 1. A sense of control
   - Feeling that we can affect our fate
 2. A belief in the value of something
  - Find something worth believing in, working towards, striving for
 3. Community
   - A group that values what we value and is working towards achieving those things

Foreword  
- Abraham recounts when he met Paul at Stanford, where Paul worked as a neurosurgical chief resident after studying English and biology as an undergrad and got a master's in English literature  
- Like Paul's "Road to Damascus", Paul Kalanithi became a physician instead of going down his path towards an English professor  
- Abraham deeply admires Paul's writing  
> "Paul's writing was simply stunning... Out of his pen he was spinning gold" (pg. xv)  

Prologue  
- Paul spent years of training examining CT scans, but now sees his own, showing cancer "widely disseminated" (pg. 3)  
- Paul recounts how he came to discover his cancer, which began with weight loss and back pain  
- - Paul had a lot of pain on the way to New York, and curled up on the floor of Grand Central Station on the way to a trip, which he left early  
- Paul had this feeling that they'd gone through "the most difficult part of our journey" (pg. 9), he and his wife were peaking in their careers, and Paul had one year left in residency  
> "the future I had imagined, the one just about to be realized, the culmination of decades of striving, evaporated" (pg. 16)  


Part 1  
- Paul recounts how his family moved from NY to Kingman Arizona, the least educated district in America, and how his mom was worried for her kids' education and pushed to transform the Kingman school system and curriculum  
- His mom got him into reading books to prep for college, and Paul fell in love with books  
> "Books became my closest confidants, finely ground lenses providing new views of the world" (pg. 27)
