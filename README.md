# JC's Reading/Watching List

A record for myself, and a resource for others, of all the books, videos, podcasts, movies, etc. that I've gained some knowledge from. 

My goals:

1. Learn. And encourage others to learn.
1. Document key takeaways from each book, both to commit the knowledge to memory and to share the knowledge to my future self and others.
2. Record my progress over time, track my ongoing goals, and actively continue learning!

If you have any suggestions or want to discuss any of the books, hit me up on IG, [@kingjcdy](https://www.instagram.com/kingjcdy/)!

# 2021

**[Alice in Borderland](https://www.netflix.com/title/80200575)** on Netflix
> _Watched season 1 with the roommats as part of our weekly movie afternoons. The show is thrilling, unpredictable, and full of uncovered mysteries, but it ended on a cliffhanger so I'll have to wait til season 2 to be released for (hopefully) some closure. I've been inspired to learn Japanese on Duolingo, Lingodeer, and YouTube for fun!_
