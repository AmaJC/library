# JC's Reading/Watching List

A record for myself, and a resource for others, of all the books, videos, podcasts, movies, etc. that I've gained some knowledge from. 

My goals:

1. Learn. And encourage others to learn.
1. Document key takeaways from each book, both to commit the knowledge to memory and to share the knowledge to my future self and others.
2. Record my progress over time, track my ongoing goals, and actively continue learning!

If you have any suggestions or want to discuss any of the books, hit me up on IG, [@jcdythatsme](https://www.instagram.com/jcdythatsme/)!

**[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713)** by Mark Manson
> _A nontraditional perspective of how we can find happiness in life. This book challenges you to embrace failure as a means for growth, always be willing to be wrong and be less certain of yourself, choose the f*cks that you believe are worth giving, and be conscious of and constantly remind ourselves of our inevitable death. I read this book almost entirely while flying in planes, and its perspectives are so valuable and insightful._

**[TED Talk: Are We In Control of our Own Decisions?](https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions)** by Dan Ariely
> _Optical illusions are a metaphor for "decision illusions" or "cognitive illusions" in behavioral economics. The person who designs the form at the DMV for organ donations can influence/dictate our behavior/likelihood to accept - it is the illusion of decision. "We pick what was chosen for us". Our minds are susceptible to influences from external forces (e.g. defaults, the options presented to us, etc) - in other words, our decision-making is predictably irrational._

**[The Good Place](https://www.netflix.com/title/80113701)** on Netflix
> _Thought-provoking and unpredictable series. One of my favorites. Makes me think about how we should be judged as "good/righteous vs bad/unrighteous". Does intention or outcome matter more in terms of morality? Should people be given a chance after life on earth? Does an eternal life of bliss lose all meaning because the value of life is tied to its impermanence?_

**[Alice in Borderland](https://www.netflix.com/title/80200575)** on Netflix
> _Watched season 1 with the roommats as part of our weekly movie afternoons. The show is thrilling, unpredictable, and full of uncovered mysteries, but it ended on a cliffhanger so I'll have to wait til season 2 to be released for (hopefully) some closure. I've been inspired to learn Japanese on Duolingo, Lingodeer, and YouTube for fun!_

# 2020

**[Masterclass - Economics and Society](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/paul-krugman-teaches-economics-and-society)** by Paul Krugman
> _First Masterclass course taken, before switching over to Gordon Ramsay's cooking class about a quarter way through. Watched virtually with Andie and Arvin._

**[Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)** by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, Grady Booch

> _Read this book as part of my team's weekly book club. Each week, one of our team members would summarize and review one design pattern, and we would contribute examples within our team's codebase demonstrating that specific design pattern._

# 2019

**[The Case For a Creator](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Creator-Lee-Strobel/dp/0310242096)** by Lee Strobel
> _Read a few pages of this book daily as part of my commute to work, the spring semester I started attending the Gracepoint fellowship for a time while I still lived at Berkeley._
