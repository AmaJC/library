## Chapter 1 - Crying in H Mart
- H Mart is a supermarket that specializes in Asian food  
- Brings back many memories of childhood for Michelle and parachute children  
> " I wonder how many people at H Mart miss their families." (pg. 8)  
- Food as a motherly expression of love, eating to feel connected to the loved ones people miss, celebrating those people through food  
> "When I go to H Mart... I'm searching for memories. I'm collecting the evidence that the Korean half of my identity didn't die when they did." (pg. 11)

## Chapter 2 - Save Your Tears
- Michelle recounts all the "usuals" and favorite foods of her mom  
> "That was how my mother loved you. not through white lies and constant verbal affirmation, but in subtle observations of what brought you joy" (pg. 14)  
- Stereotypical Asian parent expression of love - less of words of affirmation, very "tiger parent" like which could be motivating but also cause a lot of stress and pressure  
 - "always save 10%" (pg. 18)  
	- A form of self-protection, don't put yourself in a position where you're entirely giving yourself to someone else  
- Expression of how Michelle's mom doesn't want to be hurt  
- The irony of how her mom wanted to prevent her from being hurt, actually caused Michelle to be hurt in some ways  
- Michelle's mom is very meticulous and clean, obsessed with skin care routine and cleaning and keeping clothes and possessions perfect  
- In contrast, her mom is very loose when it comes to food  
- She believed "food should be enjoyed" and wouldn't force her to finish the plate, believing it "more of a waste to expand your stomach than to keep eating when you were full" (pg. 22)  
- Her only rule was that you had to try everything once  
- Her parents loved good food and Michelle learned to be courageous with trying exotic food, considering herself an honorary guest at her parent's table

## Chapter 3 - Double Lid
> "Like food, beauty was an integral part of Korean culture" (pg. 32)  
> “‘Yeppeu,’ or pretty was frequently employed as a synonym for good and well-behaved, and this fusion of moral and aesthetic approval was an early introduction to the value of beauty and the rewards it had in store” (p. 33)
- Korean beauty standards - double eyelid, small face, white skin  
- Highest rates of cosmetic surgery  
- Likely influenced by how in language "yeppeu" - pretty, was frequently employed as a synonym for good or well behaved.  
- Reflection - language influences how we think, it even exists in English - whitelist vs blacklist  
- " Fusion of moral and aesthetic approval" feeds into the cultural value of beauty  
- She compares getting famous as a pretty girl in Seoul to the pet alligator in the Chinese restaurant - "caged and gawked at in its luxurious confinement"  
> "I didn't think about the guilt she might have felt for all the years spent away from her mother" (pg. 35)  
  
- Where did the western view on Asians as being submissive come from?  
- Asian cultures have many societal traditions and expectations that may influence e.g. "saving face" or being family oriented, honorific, respect your elders

How I felt it most when he drove up to New York at 3am just to hold me.. after i'd discovered my mother was sick...
