## Chapter 1 - Don't Try
> "The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time." (pg. 7)
* Our society tells us to pursue goals that force us to fixate on what we _lack_. Be richer. Be smarter. Be more popular. Buy a nice house, acquire a high paying job, buy a nice car, get a relationship.

> "The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important." (pg. 8)
* If you're truly confident, you don't feel the need to prove you're confident. If you're truly rich, you don't need to convince anyone you are.
* Giving too many fucks can lead us to grow attached to a mirage of ideas that will supposedly give us happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment - all of which are ultimately hollow, superficial, and fake.

> "The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience." (pg. 10)
* We have become victims of our own success. Especially with social media/technology making it so easy to see all the things we don't have, we are constantly reminded of what we lack, how we don't measure up, why we're not good enough.
* The "[Backwards Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPhc9FU7ycI)" is a term coined by Alan Watts to describe how the more you try to escape the negatives of life, the more negative the negative becomes. Wanting to be richer can make you feel poorer and more unworthy. Wanting to be more attractive can make you feel uglier. The more you want to be loved, the lonelier you will become.

**Subtleties of Not Giving a F*ck**

1. Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
	 - Not giving a fuck ≠ not caring about anything. Doing that would be to act out of fear. It's part of life to give a fuck. "You must give a fuck about something... What do we give a fuck about? What are we choosing to give a fuck about?" Be willing to stand by your convictions and values, overcome adversity, and be willing to fail because you know it's the right thing to do.

2. To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity."
	 - When you have no problems, the mind invents some. "First world problems" arise because we have nothing more important to worry about. Find what is meaningful and important in your life because you'll otherwise start giving fucks to the meaningless.
3. Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about
      - With experience and maturity, we realize that the small things have little impact to our lives in the long term (e.g. people's opinions of us, what outfit we wore, etc). 
      - "Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy."

---
> "The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not." (pg. 18)
* In life, suffering is inevitable. Failure, hardship, loss, death. We need to learn to be comfortable with life's shit, and empower ourselves to use our pain/suffering/problems as a means for progress and growth.

## Chapter 2 - Happiness is a Problem
> "We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change." (pg. 23)
* Buddhism centers around the realization that life itself is a form of suffering.
	* "Pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them."
* Biologically, we benefit from suffering, dissatisfaction, and insecurity, because that drives us to act to improve our chances of survival. Suffering is not a bug, but a feature of our humanity. Pain teaches us to adhere to our own physical limitations - what's good/safe vs bad/harmful.
> "Life is essentially an endless series of problems... Don’t hope for a life without problems. There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems." (pg. 24)
* Solving problems makes us happy. "True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving." 
* Negative emotions serve a purpose. While good emotions are rewards for having done the right action, negative emotions are a _call to action_ - you're supposed to do something. Negative emotions can help us solve problems.
* Hedonic treadmill - we work to improve our life situation but end up feeling the same, and "quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness"
> "Because happiness requires struggle. It grows from problems... Real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles." (pg. 29)
* The easy question is "What do you want in life?" or "What do you want to enjoy?". The hard question that matters is "What pain are you willing to sustain?" or "What suffering will you choose to go through to achieve success and happiness?"
> "I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory." (pg. 31)
* The author dreamt of becoming a rockstar and fantasized about it for half his life. But though he was in love with the result, he wasn't in love with the process - and so he failed.
* Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. Our struggles determine our successes.

## Chapter 3 - You Are Not Special

* In the 1960's, research found that people who have high self-esteem (positive thoughts/feelings about oneself) was linked to better performance (e.g. academic and career success, lower crime, etc). 
	* Self-esteem practices began to manifest in the 1970s - grade inflation, participation awards, pastors preaching "we are all special in God's eyes", and more.
	* BUT, teaching people to feel good about themselves doesn't guarantee real success. "It turns out that adversity and failure are actually useful and even necessary for developing strong-minded and successful adults." (pg. 34)
	* Unfounded self-confidence leads to delusional **entitlement**.
* Entitled people "feels as though they deserves good things without actually earning them."
	* "They become so fixated on feeling good about themselves that they manage to delude themselves into believing that they are accomplishing great things even when they’re not." (pg. 34)
	* Entitled people view everything that happens to them as either an affirmation of their greatness, or a threat to it. They reinforce their entitlement by distorting what is around them to uplift their sense of superiority (e.g. accusing that people who question their accomplishments/greatness are just jealous)
	* Entitled behavior can take two forms:
		1. I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment. 
		2. I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment. (e.g. victim mentality)
> "A person who actually has a high self-worth is able to look at the negative parts of his character frankly—“Yes, sometimes I’m irresponsible with money,” “Yes, sometimes I exaggerate my own successes,” “Yes, I rely too much on others to support me and should be more self-reliant”—and then acts to improve upon them." (pg. 36)
* Self-esteem is linked to your ability to acknowledge your shortcomings, rather than to delude yourself into being blind to any weaknesses or room for improvement.
> "This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal. And because we’re all quite average most of the time, the deluge of exceptional information drives us to feel pretty damn insecure and desperate, because clearly we are somehow not good enough." (pg. 44)
* Entitlement in today's age may be fueled by social media and technology as they enable our insecurities to run amok.
	* Despite the vast majority of life being average and unextraordinary, the Internet, YouTube, Facebook, etc publicize the exceptional and extraordinary.
	* **Mass-media-driven exceptionalism** - the way in which the pervasiveness of technology and mass marketing makes it easy for us to establish unrealistic standards for ourselves, because we are overexposed to the exreme standards we fail to live up to.
> "The Internet has not just open-sourced information; it has also open-sourced insecurity, self-doubt, and shame" (pg. 45)
* Our culture tells us that we're all destined to be extraordinary - that we deserve greatness. Since being "average" is considered failure, some people resort to being at the low end of the bell curve (oppression olympics) to prove they are the most victimized/miserable.
* The truly exceptional people are those that realize that they are *not* exceptional, and use that knowledge to constantly pursue self-improvement. People who become great first realize that they're not great, and that they can be so much better.
	* We should embrace our mundane existence - We are not special, and that's okay. Then we can shed off the pressure and self-imposed expectations to be amazing and extraordinary, and appreciate the ordinary things in life.

## Chapter 4 - The Value of Suffering
* The chapter begins with a story about two Japanese men who both suffered for seemingly useless or destructive causes. 
	* A Japanese soldier, Hiroo Onoda, who was ordered to never surrender to the Americans on the island of Lubang in the Philippines, who continued to live and fight in the jungle even years after WWII ended.
	* A Japanese adventurer who traveled the world, discovered Onoda, and years later died in the Himalayas while searching for the yeti.
> "To both men, their suffering meant something; it fulfilled some greater cause. And because it meant something, they were able to endure it, or perhaps even enjoy it." (pg. 50)
* Since suffering in life is unavoidable, instead of working to end suffering, we should answer "Why are we suffering - for what purpose?"
* Suffering can be endured when the purpose has meaning to you.
> "Self-awareness is like an onion." (pg. 51)
* Layer 1 of the self-awareness onion: a simple understanding of one’s emotions.
* Layer 2: an ability to ask why we feel certain emotions.
	* Answering _why_ is often difficult and takes a lot of practice
	* Usually uncovers what we consider as success/failure
* Layer 3: our personal values.
	* Why do I consider this to be success/failure? 
	* How am I choosing to measure myself? 
	* By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?
	* Our values are the basis for all our thoughts, emotions, and perceptions of ourselves and our situations. What's most important is not the particular situation's details, but instead how we measure and value it.
> "We get to control what our problems mean based on how we choose to think about them, the standard by which we choose to measure them." (pg. 55)
* Naturally, we measure ourselves against others. The question is not whether we evaluate/compare ourselves to others, but by _what standard_ we measure ourselves.
* If we measure ourselves by "I don't want to work for a boss I hate" or "I want to earn enough money to send my kid to a good school", then being a famous rockstar would be unimaginably successful. But if we measure ourselves as "I want to be more popular and successful than ____", then we can have it all and still feel like a failure.
* To change how we view our problems, we must change how we measure failure/success.

**Shitty Values**
Common values that create unsolvable problems
1. **Pleasure** - research shows that those who focus on superficial pleasures have more anxiety, emotional instability, and rates of depression
   a. Pleasure is what people often fixate on, it numbs and distracts us.
   b. Pleasure alone isn't sufficient - it is not the cause of happiness, it is the effect. "If you get the other stuff right (the other values and metrics), then pleasure will naturally occur as a by-product."
2. **Material Success** - measuring our self worth on things like how much money you make, the car you drive, how big your house is, etc. 
	a. Research shows that after basic needs are met (shelter, food, etc), the correlation between happiness and worldly success approaches zero.
	b. An extra 10K may mean a lot if you're starving in India, but as a middle-class citizen in California, killing yourself working overtime for an extra 10K won't affect much overall.
	c. Overvaluing material success can lead to prioritizing it over more important values, like honesty/nonviolence/compassion.
3. **Always Being Right** - measuring our self worth based on always being right will prevent us from being able to learn from our mistakes, take on new perspectives, and empathize with others
   a. It's more helpful to assume you're ignorant, to promote a constant state of learning and growth.
   > "Our brains are inefficient machines. We consistently make poor assumptions, misjudge probabilities, misremember facts, give in to cognitive biases, and make decisions based on our emotional whims. As humans, we’re wrong pretty much constantly, so if your metric for life success is to be right—well, you’re going to have a difficult time rationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself." 
4. **Staying Positive** - always looking at life situations in a positive light may mean denying negative emotions - constant positivity can be a form of avoidance.
	a. Staying positive all the time denies the existence of life's problems, which removes the chance of solving those problems to generate happiness
	b. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health
	c. Negative emotions should be expressed (1) in a socially acceptable, healthy manner, and (2) in a way that aligns with your values
> “One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful.”
* This is why the above values are unideal. Some of the greatest moments of one’s life are **not** pleasant, **not** successful, **not** known, and **not** positive.
	 
**Defining Good/Bad Values**
* Good values are reality-based, socially constructive, immediate, and controllable
	* E.g. Honesty - you have complete control over this, it benefits others (although may be unpleasant)
	* Innovation, vulnerability, standing up for oneself, standing up for others, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity.
	* These values are achieved internally
* Bad values are superstitious, socially destructive, not immediate, or uncontrollable.
	* E.g. Popularity - you have no control over this, isn't realistic (feeling popular or unpopular without knowing how everyone thinks of you)
	* Dominance through manipulation or violence, indiscriminate fucking, feeling good all the time, always being the center of attention, not being alone, being liked by everybody, being rich for the sake of being rich.
	* These values are generally reliant on external events
> "What “self-improvement” is really about: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about. Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life."

## Chapter 5 - You Are Always Choosing
> "When we feel we are choosing our own problems, we are empowered. When we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimized and miserable." (pg. 66)
* Realizing that we individually are responsible for how we interpret what happens to us and how we respond, regardless of the external circumstances, allows for personal improvement and growth
* We are always responsible for our experiences - how we interpret and respond to events in our lives
	* Often, the same event can be good or bad depending on the metric we use.
	*	Choosing to take responsibility in our lives gives us more power to exercise. 
	*	Accepting responsibility for our problems is the first step to solving them.
		*	Taking responsibility for our successes isn't nearly as valuable as taking responsibility for our problems - that's where real improvement comes from
*	Responsibility != fault - many hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they think it means admitting fault, but they aren't the same
	*	Fault is past tense (choices have been made already)
	*	Responsibility is present tense (the choices you're currently making)
	*	Many people may be to _blame_ for your unhappiness, but you alone are responsible for your unhappiness. We always can choose how to see/react to/value things
> "People who consistently make the best choices in the situations they’re given are the ones who eventually come out ahead in poker, just as in life. And it’s not necessarily the people with the best cards." (pg. 77)
* We are all dealt cards in life, some better than others. But the choices we make ultimately determine the outcome - we are responsible to make the best choice we can, regardless of our circumstances, regardless of who's at fault.
* **Victimhood Chic** - a tactic used to push responsibility off of one's self through blame on others as being at fault for their oppression
* **Outrage Porn** - media that broadcasts mildly offensive content to generate outrage 
	* How to approach the media: with a healthy dose of skepticism. We should avoid painting those who disagree with us with a broad brush.
* There will be uncertainty, discomfort, and resistance (internal and external) as we reassess and change our values. This is normal.

## Chapter 6 - You're Wrong About Everything (But So Am I)
* As our Present self can look back at our Past self and point out flaws/mistakes, our Future self will look at our Present self and do the same thing. This is good, and is a sign of continued growth.
> "Growth is an endlessly iterative process." (pg. 83)
* We are always going to be wrong - about ourselves, others, society, the world, etc.
* Instead of finding the "perfect" right answer, we should continue to learn so every day we "chip away at the ways we're wrong today" to become a little less wrong tomorrow.
* Everyone has different life circumstances, so what's "right" for them and how their lives should be lived could be different from ours.
	* Even as we grow older, the "correct" way to live will change and evolve.
> "Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are." (pg. 84)
*	Admitting when we are wrong -> opens up the opportunity for change and growth
*	Our memory is unreliable - we may remember an experience slightly differently a few days later, and come to believe in mental filled-in gaps that are not real.
	*	We all do this - the brain is designed to be efficient, not accurate. Our brain is biased - influenced by what we believe and have already experienced
	*	Maybe we should trust ourselves LESS rather than "going with your gut". 
	*	"Our hearts and minds are so unreliable, maybe we should be questioning our intentions. and motivations _more_."
* Since we're wrong all the time, we should challenge our own beliefs with self-skepticism.
> "The more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. But the converse is true as well: the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know." (pg. 95)
* Benefits of uncertainty
	* Removes the judgment of others (benefit of the doubt)
	* Prevents us from using stereotypes and biases to view others
	* Relieves us of judgment of ourselves - remain uncertain of who we are and what we can do, and be open to finding out through experience.
	* Admitting we don't know allows us to grow

**Manson's Law of Avoidance**
* Manson's Law of Avoidance - The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.
	* People are often afraid of success just as much as they are afraid of failure - because it threatens who they believe themselves to be.
	* e.g. being an "Artist Nobody Likes" is far scarier than being an "Artist Nobody's Heard Of" 
	* Don't "find yourself" and box yourself in to a persona. Keep striving, keep discovering

**Kill Yourself**
* Buddhism says that your idea of "you" is an arbitrary mental construction that can trap you, and that we should let go of the idea of "you" - i.e. not give a fuck
	* When you believe that your the stupid one that will be laughed at in class, or the one people will mock or ignore, you're telling yourself you're the _exception_. This is a manifestation of narcissism. 
	* Instead, realize you aren't special. Your problems aren't unique. 
		* Stop defining ourselves as "uniquely intelligent" or "spectacularly talented" or "especially victimized"
	* We should define ourselves in the most simple, mundane, ordinary ways - e.g. as a student, a friend, a creator.

**How To Be Less Certain of Yourself**
Ways to start questioning and doubting yourself, and foster more uncertainty in our lives:
1. _Question 1: What if I'm wrong?_
* We're the world's worst observers of ourselves. We often don't realize when we're jealous, acting on our insecurities, angry, etc.
	* Put "cracks in our armor of uncertainty" by questioning ourselves and how we might be wrong about ourselves
	* Questioning ourselves can foster humility (instead of arrogant certainty) and compassion (instead of stubborn entitlement)
* For any change to occur in our lives, we must first realize and accept when we are wrong. 
2. _Question 2: What would it mean if I were wrong?_
* The potential implications of our wrongness can often be painful - it forces us to question our values
> "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” (pg. 101)
 * The ability to evaluate and consider different values without necessarily adopting them is crucial to change in our lives
3. _Question 3: Would being wrong create a better or worse problem than my current problem, for both myself and others?_
* Life's problems are endless, so we should be choosing the better problem.
* By mistrusting our own abilities to determine absolute right and wrong, we foster humility and sustain healthy, happy relationships
	* This allows us to grow beyond our insecurities by recognizing when we are wrong
* We often act out on our own insecurities and flawed certainties
> When it feels like "you versus the world", chances are it's really just "you versus yourself" (pg. 102)

## Chapter 7 - Failure Is The Way Forward
* Mark starts the chapter sharing about how he started off adult life as a failure - already at rock bottom financially, with the start of the Great Recession
	* He considers himself fortunate because everyone's biggest fear later in life is to be a failure, and already starting off as a failure makes every other opportunity for failure less scary
	* Mark learned early on **not** to measure his self-worth by money
		* He saw his wealthy family make a lot of money but still be miserable, or see broke people still being happy
		* Therefore, the metric used to measure failure would be to _not_ pursue his own dreams - not a lack of money.

**The Failure/Success Paradox**
* Improvement at anything is based on thousands of tiny failures 
* **If someone is better than you at something, it's likely they've failed at it more than you have.**
* Our habits of avoiding failure
	* Our education system, which judges our performance and punishes those who don't do well, may contribute to a learned fear of failure
* We should define goals that we can continuously work on throughout life
	* A goal like "graduate college" or "buy a house" may drive us in the short-term, but ultimately when complete we lose the problem that drove us to grow
	* Instead, a goal like "be more authentic in my social life" gives us the ability to grow continuously, with every social interaction as new opportunity presenting its own challenges

**Pain is Part of the Process**
* Survivors of WWII experienced mass starvation, bombings, torture, etc., but said that their pre-war versions of their selves were "ungrateful for and unappreciative of their loved ones, lazy and consumed by petty problems, entitled to all they’d been given" (pg. 107)
	* After the war, they felt more confident, more grateful, unfazed by life's trivial pettiness and annoyances
* Our pain can make us more grounded, stronger, more resilient
	* Suffering emotional pain is needed to develop greater emotional resilience, a stronger sense of self, increased compassion, etc
> "You could call it “hitting bottom” or “having an existential crisis.” I prefer to call it “weathering the shitstorm.” (pg. 108)
* **VCR Question** - like Mark's parents not knowing how to work the VCR, we sometimes sit and stare at our problems and shake our heads, asking "How??"
	* A VCR question seems difficult to anyone experiencing it, but so simple to anyone else
	* The answer is simple - just do it, despite the pain. Accept that you really don’t know what the fuck you’re doing, so there's nothing to lose

**The "Do Something" Principle**
> "Don’t just sit there. Do something. The answers will follow" (pg. 111)
* Even if you don't know what you're doing, just the simple act of working on it will help you find the right ideas and answers.
> "Action isn’t just the effect of motivation; it’s also the cause of it." (pg. 112)
* We assume the flow goes: Emotional Inspiration -> Motivation -> Desirable Action
* Actually, motivation is an endless loop:
	* Inspiration -> Motivation -> Action -> Inspiration -> Motivation -> Action -> ...
	* Our actions create further emotional reactions and inspirations that motivate future actions
	* We can reorient our mindset to view this chain as:
	* Action -> Inspiration -> Motivation
		* If you lack the motivation to make a change, _do something_.
* The "Do Something" principle changes our standard of success to "merely acting"
	* Failure seems unimportant when _any_ result is viewed as progress
	* Inspiration is seen as a reward rather than as a prerequisite
	* With simply "doing something" as your metric for success, then even failure pushes you forward.

## Chapter 8 - The Importance of Saying No
* Mark spent 5 years living a nomadic lifestyle, living in 55 countries while making money through his online blog. Now he has settled in New York, with a wife and a home.
	* Mark says that his life of "freedom" was not inherently meaningful
	* "Ultimately, the only way to achieve meaning and a sense of importance... is through a _narrowing_ of freedom, a choice of commitment to one place, one belief, or one person." (pg. 116)
* Mark spent some time in Russia, where he experienced a different culture
	* Russian culture normalized outright, straightforward bluntness in conversation, which contrasted fake-nice communication common in Anglo culture
	* In Western culture, there's so much pressure to be liked or to present ourselves well, that people sometimes reconfigure their personality depending on who they're with
		* Ex: smile and say polite things even when you don't feel like it
		* Ex: saying white lies to people you disagree with

**Rejection makes your life better**
* We _need_ to reject some things. There is joy with investing in a single thing after rejecting the alternatives.
* The act of choosing a value requires rejecting the alternatives
	* Ex: Choosing to be in a committed relationship could require rejecting hookups
	* Ex: Choosing to invest in open/honest friendships requires rejecting trashing your friends behind their backs
* Becoming comfortable with rejection and saying/hearing "no" will improve our relationships and emotional lives by being more honest

**Boundaries**
* While _Romeo and Juliet_ is often glorified today as the ideal "romance", Shakespeare meant to _satirize_ romance through that story - more of a "do not do this" warning.
* There are healthy and unhealthy forms of love
	* Unhealthy romance - people trying to escape their problems, using each other as an escape
	* Healthy romance - two people acknowledging and addressing their own problems, while supporting each other
* Two factors are important in determining a healthy/unhealthy relationship	
	* 1. How well each person in the relationship accepts responsibility
	* 2. The willingness of each person to both reject and be rejected by their partner
* *Boundaries* - refers to the delineation between two people's responsibilities for their own problems
	* Healthy boundaries - take responsibility for your own values, not take responsibility for your partner's values
	* Poor boundaries - avoid responsibility for your own problems and/or take responsibility for your partner's problems 
> "People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy." (pg. 123)
* An unhealthy relationship is one in which you try to solve each other's problems to feel good about themselves
* A healthy relationship is one in which you solve your own problems to feel good about each other
* Entitled people expect others to solve their own problems
	* Many entitled people paint themselves as the victim, expecting someone to save them
	* Entitled people who take the "blame" for their partner's problems believe that if they can "fix" their partner, they will get the love and appreciation they want
		* Toxic relationship: victim and the savior - someone who starts fires because it makes them feel important, and someone who puts them out because it makes them feel important
		* The victim SHOULD say "Look, this is my problem, you don't have to fix it for me. Just support me while I fix it myself."
		* The savior SHOULD say "Look, you're blaming others for your own problems, solve them yourself"
* In a healthy relationship:
	* You may hurt someone's feelings sometimes, but recognize you're ultimately not responsible for determining how others feel
	* You don't control each other's emotions, but instead each person should support the other in their individual growth and in solving their own problems
	* "It’s not about giving a fuck about everything your partner gives a fuck about; it’s about giving a fuck about your partner regardless of the fucks he or she gives. That’s unconditional love, baby." (pg. 126)

**How to Build Trust**
* Without conflict, there is no trust. Conflict exists to show us who is there for us unconditionally
	* Pain in a relationship allows trust in each other to be cemented, creating greater intimacy
* Both people must be willing to hear no and say no
* Trust is necessary to feel loved, because the relationship is meaningless without it
	* You don't feel truly loved until you trust the love expressed is without special conditions or baggage attached
	* How to rebuild trust
		* 1. The trust-breaker admits the bad values that cause the breach in trust and takes responsibility for them
		* 2. The trust-breaker builds a solid track record of improved performance

**Freedom Through Commitment**
* Consumer culture teaches us to want more more more. But, more is not always better. We're often happier with less.
* **Paradox of choice** - the more options we're given, the less satisfied we become with whatever we choose, because we're aware of the other options we're forfeiting
	* Having too many choices can leave you in a limbo avoiding commitment, out of a fear of making the "wrong" or "imperfect" choice to maximize your happiness
* Depth vs Breadth of experience
	* Investing deeply in one person/place/job denies us the breadth of experience, while pursuing a breadth may also deny us the rewards of depth of experience.
	* When pursuing a wide breadth of experience, each new experience provides diminishing returns
	* The older you get, the more experienced, and the less significantly each new experience affects you
	* There is great value in depth of experience and commitment, e.g. investing in significant, genuine, healthy friendships

How commitment increases your freedom
1. You're no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous
2. Hones your attention and focus, directed towards what makes you most healthy and happy
3. Makes decision-making easier, removes fear of missing out because of your security in that what you already have is enough
4. Allows for a focus on highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than otherwise
> "Yes, breadth of experience is likely necessary and desirable when you’re young—after all, you have to go out there and discover what seems worth investing yourself in. But depth is where the gold is buried. And you have to stay committed to something and go deep to dig it up. That’s true in relationships, in a career, in building a great lifestyle—in everything." (pg. 131)

## Chapter 9 - ...And Then You Die
* In the face of the inevitability of death, there is no reason to ever give in to your fear or embarrassment or shame
* By avoiding what is painful and uncomfortable, you avoid being alive at all
* Even though death often scares us, it is death that gives life meaning 
* _Denial of Death_ by Becker is one of the most influential psychological works and makes two points:
	* Humans are unique in that we are the only animals that can conceptualize and think about ourselves abstractly (e.g. worrying about our career, think about past mistakes/regret, contemplate the future, etc)
		* This makes us aware of the inevitability of our deaths
	* We have 2 "selves" - (1) our physical self that eats/sleeps/poops, and (2) our conceptual self - our identity and how we see ourselves
		* **Immortality project** - our attempts to get our conceptual self to last past our physical death (e.g. work to get our names on statues, or have children that we leave our impact on so we are remembered/revered/idolized)
		* "All the meaning of our life is shaped by this innate desire to never truly die" (pg. 137)
		* Death terror creeps back when the conceptual self outliving the physical self is not possible or likely, and all meaning is lost
> "Once we become comfortable with the fact of our own death—the root terror, the underlying anxiety motivating all of life’s frivolous ambitions—we can then choose our values more freely, unrestrained by the illogical quest for immortality" (pg. 138)
* Conclusion: people's immortality projects are the problem, not the solution. The bitter antidote is to come to terms with the inevitability of our own death

**The Sunny Side of Death**
* Keep death in mind at all times, to appreciate life more and stay humble in the face of adversity 
* “The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.” - Mark Twain
> "Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it obliterates all the crappy, fragile, superficial values in life" (pg. 142)
* People chase after money, fame, validation - but death confronts us with the question of "What is your legacy? What mark will you have made? How will you have changed the world for the better?"
* Without acknowledging the ever-present gaze of death, the superficial will appear important, and the important will appear superficial.
	* Because death is the only thing we know for certain, it should be our compass that orients our values and decisions
	* Happiness comes from caring about something greater than yourself - believing that you are a contributing component of something greater 
* People in the modern world often feel entitled - making us believe that we are the center of the universe, that we deserve that society caters to our own feelings
* Whether you realize it or not, you are great already. Not because of superficial things (e.g. early graduation, career, etc) - but because "in the face of endless confusion and certain death, you continue to choose what to give a fuck about and what not to." (pg. 144)
* "We’re all going to die, all of us. What a circus! That alone should make us love each other, but it doesn’t. We are terrorized and flattened by life’s trivialities; we are eaten up by nothing.”
* The primary lesson of coming to terms with our deaths is that **thre is nothing to be afraid of.**
	* Acceptance of our death, understanding of our own fragility, makes it easier to confront your own entitlement, accepting failures, embracing rejection
