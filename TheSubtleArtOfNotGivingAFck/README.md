## Chapter 1 - Don't Try
> "The world is constantly telling you that the path to a better life is more, more, more—buy more, own more, make more, fuck more, be more. You are constantly bombarded with messages to give a fuck about everything, all the time." (pg. 7)
* Our society tells us to pursue goals that force us to fixate on what we _lack_. Be richer. Be smarter. Be more popular. Buy a nice house, acquire a high paying job, buy a nice car, get a relationship.

> "The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it’s giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important." (pg. 8)
* If you're truly confident, you don't feel the need to prove you're confident. If you're truly rich, you don't need to convince anyone you are.
* Giving too many fucks can lead us to grow attached to a mirage of ideas that will supposedly give us happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment - all of which are ultimately hollow, superficial, and fake.

> "The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience." (pg. 10)
* We have become victims of our own success. Especially with social media/technology making it so easy to see all the things we don't have, we are constantly reminded of what we lack, how we don't measure up, why we're not good enough.
* The "[Backwards Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPhc9FU7ycI)" is a term coined by Alan Watts to describe how the more you try to escape the negatives of life, the more negative the negative becomes. Wanting to be richer can make you feel poorer and more unworthy. Wanting to be more attractive can make you feel uglier. The more you want to be loved, the lonelier you will become.

**Subtleties of Not Giving a F*ck**

1. Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.
	 - Not giving a fuck ≠ not caring about anything. Doing that would be to act out of fear. It's part of life to give a fuck. "You must give a fuck about something... What do we give a fuck about? What are we choosing to give a fuck about?" Be willing to stand by your convictions and values, overcome adversity, and be willing to fail because you know it's the right thing to do.

2. To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity."
	 - When you have no problems, the mind invents some. "First world problems" arise because we have nothing more important to worry about. Find what is meaningful and important in your life because you'll otherwise start giving fucks to the meaningless.
3. Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about
      - With experience and maturity, we realize that the small things have little impact to our lives in the long term (e.g. people's opinions of us, what outfit we wore, etc). 
      - "Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy."

> "The idea of not giving a fuck is a simple way of reorienting our expectations for life and choosing what is important and what is not." (pg. 18)
* In life, suffering is inevitable. Failure, hardship, loss, death. We need to learn to be comfortable with life's shit, and empower ourselves to use our pain/suffering/problems as a means for progress and growth.

## Chapter 2 - Happiness is a Problem
> "We suffer for the simple reason that suffering is biologically useful. It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change." (pg. 23)
* Buddhism centers around the realization that life itself is a form of suffering.
	* "Pain and loss are inevitable and we should let go of trying to resist them."
* Biologically, we benefit from suffering, dissatisfaction, and insecurity, because that drives us to act to improve our chances of survival. Suffering is not a bug, but a feature of our humanity. Pain teaches us to adhere to our own physical limitations - what's good/safe vs bad/harmful.
> "Life is essentially an endless series of problems... Don’t hope for a life without problems. There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems." (pg. 24)
* Solving problems makes us happy. "True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving." 
* Negative emotions serve a purpose. While good emotions are rewards for having done the right action, negative emotions are a _call to action_ - you're supposed to do something. Negative emotions can help us solve problems.
* Hedonic treadmill - we work to improve our life situation but end up feeling the same, and "quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness"
> "Because happiness requires struggle. It grows from problems... Real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles." (pg. 29)
* The easy question is "What do you want in life?" or "What do you want to enjoy?". The hard question that matters is "What pain are you willing to sustain?" or "What suffering will you choose to go through to achieve success and happiness?"
> "I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love with not the fight but only the victory." (pg. 31)
* The author dreamt of becoming a rockstar and fantasized about it for half his life. But though he was in love with the result, he wasn't in love with the process - and so he failed.
* Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. Our struggles determine our successes.
