# Background
There are over 10,000 Kanji out there, but we only need to know roughly 2,200. For now, I'll be using JLPT levels as a measure of my progress.
* **JLPT N5: ~80 Kanji, ~36% of all written Kanji in newspapers**
* JLPT N4: ~166 Kanji, 62% of all written Kanji in newspapers
* JLPT N3: ~616 Kanji, 85.5% of all written Kanji in newspapers
* JLPT N2: ~986 Kanji, 94.4% of all written Kanji in newspapers
* JLPT N1: 2226 Kanji, 99.8% of all written Kanji in newspapers
