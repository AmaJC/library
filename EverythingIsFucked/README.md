## Chapter 1 - The Uncomfortable Truth
* The Uncomfortable Truth of Life - one day everyone you love will die, and beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will matter 
* We care and look for meaning and a sense of importance to avoid being crushed by the material insignificance of our existence 
* Hope is our psyche's mental fuel - without hope of a better future, why live?
* The opposite of happiness is NOT anger or sadness - that means you still give a fuck about something. The opposite of happiness is hopelessness - resignation, indifference, "the belief that everything is fucked so why do anything at all" (pg. 16)
* Anxiety, depression, mental issues - the root cause is rooted in hopelessness
* The avoidance of hopelessness, or the construction of hope, is our mind's primary focus
> "Hope narratives are what give our lives a sense of purpose" (pg. 18)
* Religion shields us from the Uncomfortable Truth, much less suicide and depression rates among those of faith 
* This book is an argument against nihilism, to build a case for hope

The Paradox of Progress
* Materially, the modern world is better than it has ever been, yet the Paradox of Progress is that we feel more anxious, desperate, and hopeless the better things get 
* Progress has continued uninterrupted throughout history (e.g. literacy, education, reduced violence, racism, sexism, poverty, diseases, wars, etc)
* US is on an upswing of depression, among adults and younger people
  * Feelings of loneliness and social isolation are up
> "we are the safest and most prosperous humans in the history of the world, yet we are feeling more hopeless than ever before." (pg. 21)
  * Statistics about the past don't inspire hope, hope is based on the future 
  * Hope doesn't care about problems that have already been solved. hope is only concerned about what needs to be solved

To build and maintain hope, we need:
 1. A sense of control
   - Feeling that we can affect our fate
 2. A belief in the value of something
  - Find something worth believing in, working towards, striving for
 3. Community
   - A group that values what we value and is working towards achieving those things 

## Chapter 2 - Self Control is an Illusion
* A man named Elliot had a brain tumor surgery that caused him to lose the ability to feel, while he was still able to think and reason perfectly
* The lost ability to feel caused him to lose the ability to make decisions and control his own life
> "To generate hope in our lives, we must first feel as though we have control over our lives. We must feel as though we’re following through on what we know is good and right; that we’re chasing after “something better.”" (pg. 29)
* Frontal lobotomies caused people to lose focus and the ability to make decisions or long term plans  
	* Would rather have the problem of drinking but have passion rather than having a lobotomy and no passion  
* There's often an assumption that emotions cause all our problems and reason fixes them  
	* Philosophers would posit that reason and rationality should control our emotion/unruly passion/animalistic desires  
> "The Classic Assumption says that if a person is undisciplined, unruly, or malicious, it’s because he lacks the ability to subjugate his feelings" (pg. 31)  
* Views passion and emotion as flaws  
* The classic assumption makes us hope to create "new versions" of ourselves by attributing our shortcomings to some internal deficiency  
> "We cling to this narrative about self-control because the belief that we’re in complete control of ourselves is a major source of hope." (pg. 33)  
* We want to believe that we are the masters of our own destiny  
* The fact is, we require more than willpower to achieve self control - our emotions are instrumental in decision making

### You Have Two Brains, and They’re Really Bad at Talking to Each Other  
* Our mind is a "Consciousness Car" - driving along the road of life, where an intersection is a decision we make. The car has two passengers - a Thinking Brain and Feeling Brain  
	* Thinking brain - conscious thoughts, ability to make calculations and reason, express ideas through language  
		* Thinking brain is methodical and rational, but it's also slow and takes a lot of effort  
	* Feeling brain - emotional, impulses, intuition, instincts  
		* Feeling brain arrives at conclusions quickly and effortlessly, but often inaccurate and irrational  
* The classic assumption says the driver is the thinking brain, and the feeling brain yanks the steering wheel towards whatever it thinks is fun  
> "we are moved to action only by emotion."  
* Action and emotion are inseparable - joy and smiling, anxiety and retreating, anger and tensing of muscles, etc  
* Every problem of self control (laziness, procrastination, impulsiveness, etc is an emotional, not rational problem)  
	* Emotional problems need emotional solutions - The Feeling Brain  
* Self-serving bias - the thinking brain makes up or focuses on instances that justify the feeling brain's desires - causing us to assume "what feels right is right"  
* Clown car - when the thinking brain has succumbed to the desires and appeasing of the feeling brain's cravings  
	* The clown car is what caused ancient Philosophers to warn against the overindulgence and worship of feelings, and the Church to encourage abstinence and self denial  
> "Classic Assumption: that the only way to be a good person is through dominance of the Thinking Brain over the Feeling Brain, the championing of reason over emotion, duty over desire."  
* Self control champions suppressing emotions to use logic, whereas self acceptance allows us to accept our emotions rather than work against them  
* While the Thinking Brain does not have self control, it has "meaning" control - where it can control the meaning of the feelings and impulses  
* CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) are based on the idea of teaching the Thinking Brain to cooperate with the Feeling Brain rather than judging it
* Both the Feeling and Thinking Brain provide value based knowledge
	* The Thinking Brain makes objective value associations based on facts, data, and observations
	* The Feeling Brain makes subjective value judgments on what is good/desirable and bad/undesirable

## Chapter 3 - Newton's Laws of Emotion
1. For every action, there is an equal and opposite emotional reaction.
	* Pain causes moral gaps - a sense that something wrong has happened to you (or someone else) and you deserve to be made whole again 
		* e.g. a negative moral gap - someone punches you, which generates an injustice and they deserve some form of punishment
		* e.g. a positive moral gap - someone buys you a house as a gift, which generates a sense of wanting to repay them, feeling of indebtedness
	* Moral gaps generate emotions toward equalization - a return to moral equality
		* It's a natural psychological inclination to equalize across moral gaps - to reciprocate positive for positive, negative for negative
		* "The forces that impel us to fill those moral gaps are emotions". Every action demands an equal and opposite emotional reaction.
	* "Equalization is present in every experience because the drive to equalize is emotion itself." (pg. 55)
		* Sadness - feeling of powerlessness to make up for a perceived loss
		* Anger - desire to equalize through force and aggression
		* Happiness - feeling liberated from pain
		* Guilt - feeling that you deserve some pain that never arrived
