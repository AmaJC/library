## Chapter 1 - The Uncomfortable Truth
* The Uncomfortable Truth of Life - one day everyone you love will die, and beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will matter 
* We care and look for meaning and a sense of importance to avoid being crushed by the material insignificance of our existence 
* Hope is our psyche's mental fuel - without hope of a better future, why live?
* The opposite of happiness is NOT anger or sadness - that means you still give a fuck about something. The opposite of happiness is hopelessness - resignation, indifference, "the belief that everything is fucked so why do anything at all" (pg. 16)
* Anxiety, depression, mental issues - the root cause is rooted in hopelessness
* The avoidance of hopelessness, or the construction of hope, is our mind's primary focus
> "Hope narratives are what give our lives a sense of purpose" (pg. 18)
* Religion shields us from the Uncomfortable Truth, much less suicide and depression rates among those of faith 
* This book is an argument against nihilism, to build a case for hope

The Paradox of Progress
* Materially, the modern world is better than it has ever been, yet the Paradox of Progress is that we feel more anxious, desperate, and hopeless the better things get 
* Progress has continued uninterrupted throughout history (e.g. literacy, education, reduced violence, racism, sexism, poverty, diseases, wars, etc)
* US is on an upswing of depression, among adults and younger people
  * Feelings of loneliness and social isolation are up
> "we are the safest and most prosperous humans in the history of the world, yet we are feeling more hopeless than ever before." (pg. 21)
  * Statistics about the past don't inspire hope, hope is based on the future 
  * Hope doesn't care about problems that have already been solved. hope is only concerned about what needs to be solved

To build and maintain hope, we need:
 1. A sense of control
   - Feeling that we can affect our fate
 2. A belief in the value of something
  - Find something worth believing in, working towards, striving for
 3. Community
   - A group that values what we value and is working towards achieving those things 

## Chapter 2 - Self Control is an Illusion
* A man named Elliot had a brain tumor surgery that caused him to lose the ability to feel, while he was still able to think and reason perfectly
* The lost ability to feel caused him to lose the ability to make decisions and control his own life
> "To generate hope in our lives, we must first feel as though we have control over our lives. We must feel as though we’re following through on what we know is good and right; that we’re chasing after “something better.”" (pg. 29)
* Frontal lobotomies caused people to lose focus and the ability to make decisions or long term plans  
	* Would rather have the problem of drinking but have passion rather than having a lobotomy and no passion  
* There's often an assumption that emotions cause all our problems and reason fixes them  
	* Philosophers would posit that reason and rationality should control our emotion/unruly passion/animalistic desires  
> "The Classic Assumption says that if a person is undisciplined, unruly, or malicious, it’s because he lacks the ability to subjugate his feelings" (pg. 31)  
* Views passion and emotion as flaws  
* The classic assumption makes us hope to create "new versions" of ourselves by attributing our shortcomings to some internal deficiency  
> "We cling to this narrative about self-control because the belief that we’re in complete control of ourselves is a major source of hope." (pg. 33)  
* We want to believe that we are the masters of our own destiny  
* The fact is, we require more than willpower to achieve self control - our emotions are instrumental in decision making

### You Have Two Brains, and They’re Really Bad at Talking to Each Other  
* Our mind is a "Consciousness Car" - driving along the road of life, where an intersection is a decision we make. The car has two passengers - a Thinking Brain and Feeling Brain  
	* Thinking brain - conscious thoughts, ability to make calculations and reason, express ideas through language  
		* Thinking brain is methodical and rational, but it's also slow and takes a lot of effort  
	* Feeling brain - emotional, impulses, intuition, instincts  
		* Feeling brain arrives at conclusions quickly and effortlessly, but often inaccurate and irrational  
* The classic assumption says the driver is the thinking brain, and the feeling brain yanks the steering wheel towards whatever it thinks is fun  
> "we are moved to action only by emotion."  
* Action and emotion are inseparable - joy and smiling, anxiety and retreating, anger and tensing of muscles, etc  
* Every problem of self control (laziness, procrastination, impulsiveness, etc is an emotional, not rational problem)  
	* Emotional problems need emotional solutions - The Feeling Brain  
* Self-serving bias - the thinking brain makes up or focuses on instances that justify the feeling brain's desires - causing us to assume "what feels right is right"  
* Clown car - when the thinking brain has succumbed to the desires and appeasing of the feeling brain's cravings  
	* The clown car is what caused ancient Philosophers to warn against the overindulgence and worship of feelings, and the Church to encourage abstinence and self denial  
> "Classic Assumption: that the only way to be a good person is through dominance of the Thinking Brain over the Feeling Brain, the championing of reason over emotion, duty over desire."  
* Self control champions suppressing emotions to use logic, whereas self acceptance allows us to accept our emotions rather than work against them  
* While the Thinking Brain does not have self control, it has "meaning" control - where it can control the meaning of the feelings and impulses  
* CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) are based on the idea of teaching the Thinking Brain to cooperate with the Feeling Brain rather than judging it
* Both the Feeling and Thinking Brain provide value based knowledge
	* The Thinking Brain makes objective value associations based on facts, data, and observations
	* The Feeling Brain makes subjective value judgments on what is good/desirable and bad/undesirable

## Chapter 3 - Newton's Laws of Emotion
1. For every action, there is an equal and opposite emotional reaction.
	* Pain causes moral gaps - a sense that something wrong has happened to you (or someone else) and you deserve to be made whole again 
		* e.g. a negative moral gap - someone punches you, which generates an injustice and they deserve some form of punishment
		* e.g. a positive moral gap - someone buys you a house as a gift, which generates a sense of wanting to repay them, feeling of indebtedness
	* Moral gaps generate emotions toward equalization - a return to moral equality
		* It's a natural psychological inclination to equalize across moral gaps - to reciprocate positive for positive, negative for negative
		* "The forces that impel us to fill those moral gaps are emotions". Every action demands an equal and opposite emotional reaction.
	* "Equalization is present in every experience because the drive to equalize is emotion itself." (pg. 55)
		* Sadness - feeling of powerlessness to make up for a perceived loss
		* Anger - desire to equalize through force and aggression
		* Happiness - feeling liberated from pain
		* Guilt - feeling that you deserve some pain that never arrived
	* Equalization has been codified throughout the ages, e.g. "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth", or the Golden Rule "Do unto others what you would have done unto you"
		* In evolutionary biology, also known as "reciprocal altruism"
		* In game theory, also known as "tit for tat" strategy
	* Newton's First Law generates our sense of morality, perceptions of fairness, and is the operating system of the Feeling Brain. Feeling Brain deems painful experiences as undesirable and inferior, and experiences that relieve pain as superior and desirable
	* The Thinking Brain makes lateral connections between events (sameness, contrast, cause/effect, etc)
	* The Feeling Brain makes hierarchical connections between events (better/worse, more/less desirable, morally superior/inferior, etc)
		* Growth is being able to rearrange our value hierarchy
2. Our self worth equals the sum of our emotions over time
	* "When moral gaps persist for a long time, they normalize - become our default expectation." - if equalization seems impossible, our Feeling Brain may accept defeat and judge itself to be inferior.	
	* A surrender to persisting moral gaps and acceptance of an inherent inferiority is shame or low self-worth. The reverse is true - being given stuff without earning it can cause us to believe ourselves inherently superior than actually true
	* Both high and low self worth are two sides of the same counterfeit coin - they make us believe we are special, separate from the world
		* Both versions are narcissistic and both sides believe the world should make exceptions and cater to their values and feelings over others'
		* Narcissists oscillate between feelings of superiority or inferiority
		* If you're insecure about yourself, you can find the oscillation of delusional feelings of superiority and inferiority within.
	* "Self worth is an illusion." (pg. 61)
		* We all possess a degree of narcissism because everything we ever know or learn is through experiences that are all centered around us - we are at the center of everything we experience
		* Human beings all require a level of built-in narcissism because narcissism is our last line of defense against the Uncomfortable Truth - without the perpetual lie we tell ourselves via narcissism, we would lose hope
3. Your identity will stay your identity until a new experience acts against it
	* We construct narratives to explain things in life - our narratives about ourselves and the world are about (1) something or someone's value, and (2) whether that something/someone deserves that value
		* All narratives are constructed as:
		* Good or bad thing happens to person/thing, and he/she/it does or doesn't deserve it
#### Emotional Gravity
* We attract those who value what we value and repel those whose values are contrary to our own
* The stronger we hold a value, the strong its gravity and the tighter its orbit - more difficult for outside forces to disrupt it
> "All people are more the same than they are different. We all mostly want the same things out of life. But those slight differences generate emotion, and and emotion generates a sense of importance. Therefore, we come to perceive our differences as disproportionately more important than our similarities. And this is the true tragedy of man. That we are doomed to perpetual conflict over the slight difference." (pg. 72)

## Chapter 4 - How to Make All Your Dreams Come True
* The human condition - we all struggle, and feel powerless against an inherent guilt that comes with our existence
* We forget that suffering is universal, we are all victimized to varying degrees, especially when we're young. And we all spend a lifetime trying to compensate for that suffering.
#### How to Start Your Own Religion
* We all need community and meaning, and religion is a basis for communal hope
* Religion helps us forget the Uncomfortable Truth by validating each other to feel important/worthy
1. Sell Hope to the Hopeless
> "We are the most impressionable when things are at their worst. When our life is falling apart, it signifies that our values have failed us, and we're grasping in the dark for new values to replace them." (pg. 84)
* People who lose faith in their spiritual God will look for a worldly God
* People who lose their family give themselves away to their race, creed, or nation
* People who lose faith in their government or country will look to extremist ideologies for hope
* Religious leaders preach to the poor/downtrodden/enslaved, telling them they deserve the kingdom of heaven (e.g. Jesus Christ, Moses, Buddha)
* Appealing to the hopeless - generate hope that makes people feel they are part of a greater movement - give them a sense of faith
2. Choose Your Faith
> "We all must have faith in something. Without faith, there is no hope." (pg. 85)
* e.g. you pay your mortgage because you have faith that money is real.
* e.g. you tell your kids to do their homework because you have faith that their education is important
* e.g. you have faith that happiness exists and is possible
* e.g.you have faith that living longer is worth it, so you strive to stay safe and healthy
* tl;dr - we must all believe, on faith, that _something is important_.
* The highest value at the top of our value hierarchy is called the "God Value"
	* e.g. money, family, love, prestige, spiritual leaders (Jesus Christ, Muhammad, Buddha)
	* People interpret what they experience through the prism of their God Value
	* Some people's God Value is themselves - their own pleasure and empowerment - narcissism, the religion of self aggrandizement, with faith in their own superiority and deservedness
	* Some people's God Value is another person - "codependence", sacrificing themselves for the other individual
* All religions start with a faith-based God value - a faith-based value that can produce the best future reality and gives the most hope
	* "People interpret the significance of their experiences through their values" (pg. 87)
* Evidence belongs to the Thinking Brain, whereas values are subjective and decided by the Feeling Brain
	* Evidence serves the interests of the God Value - the same event can be interpreted entirely differently (meteor destroying a town - a capitalist, atheist, traditional religious person, and hedonist would interpret that same event very differently)
> "All values are faith-based beliefs. Therefore, all hope is also based on faith, faith that something can be important and valuable and right despite the fact that there will never be a way to verify it beyond all doubt" (pg. 87)
Types of Religions
* Spiritual religions - draw hope from supernatural beliefs (existence of things outside of the physical/material realm), looking for a better future outside of this world and current life
	* e.g. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, animism, Greek mythology
	* "Hard difficulty" - lasts a long time, but high risk/high reward
	* The majority of human history has been dominated by a belief in supernatural forces, and the hope that actions/beliefs in this life would lead to rewards/improvement in the next life
		* Most of human history was fucked, no hope of material/physical improvement in their lives (e.g. plagues, wars, slavery)
		* "Old-school religion held the fabric of society together because it gave the masses a guarantee that their suffering was meaningful, that God was watching" (pg. 90)
		* Because supernatural beliefs can never be proven or disproven, spiritual religions are incredibly resilient and long-lasting 
* Ideological religions - draw hope from the natural world, look for salvation and growth regarding the world and this life
	* e.g. capitalism, communism, environmentalism, liberalism, fascism, libertarianism, nationalism, materialism, racism, veganism, etc
	* "Normal difficulty" - fairly common, but don't survive more than a few years or decades usually
	* Generate hope by constructing beliefs that certain actions will produce better outcomes in this life if they are adopted by the population at large
	* Most ideologies still rely on faith (e.g. can't scientifically prove money's intrinsic value, but it has value because we all believe it has value)
* Interpersonal religions - draw hope from other people in our lives
	* e.g. romantic love, children, sports heroes, political leaders, and celebrities
	* "Easy mode" - as common as people themselves - pretty much everyone surrenders themselves to another individual
	* Sports are a form of religion - deification/demonization of athletes, based on a faith that the lines on a green field and kicking a piece of leather around means something
	* Politics is a form of religion - whether it's a democracy or dictatorship, a small group of leaders is idolized or demonized in the social consciousness
	* Interpersonal religions give us hope that another human being will bring us salvation/happiness, that one individual or group of individuals is superior to all others
		* e.g. charismatic president, a celebrity, heroes, saints, etc
		* Fandom and worship of a figure gives fans hope for a better future (e.g. future new films/songs)
		* Familial and romantic relationships
			* Each family is its own mini-church, a group of people believing that being part of the group gives their lives meaning
			* Romantic love is idolized a source of meaning/significance in our lives as well
* "Religion is all about emotional attachment." - building those attachments is effective when you get people to stop thinking critically
3. Preemptively Invalidate All Criticism or Outside Questioning
* Adopt a belief that creates an "us-versus-them" dichotomy, where "them" is anyone who criticizes or questions "us"
	* e.g. If you don't support the war, then you support the terrorists.
	* Us-versus-them mentality cuts off reasoning or discussion with "them" before followers can question their own beliefs
	* Common enemies create unity within a religion - a scapegoat is necessary to blame for our pain and maintain hope
4. Ritual Sacrifice for Dummies - So Easy, Anyone Can Do It!
> "Rituals make our values tangible... Rituals are visual and experiential representations of what we deem important. That's why every good religion has them." (pg. 98)
* Rituals are symbolic and repeated over a long time. They embody some story or narrative (e.g. communion).
	* Rituals connect us with the past, and to our values - they affirm who we are.
* Humans are guilt-ridden creatures
	* Whether we believe God gave us life or not, we've been blessed with life - what do we do to deserve that?
		* This begs the unanswerable question of the human condition - "How can you live in such a way as to make your life worthwhile?
		* The inherent guilt of consciousness is the cornerstone of almost every spiritual religion.
		* Most religious practices are developed for the alleviation of guilt
			* Ideological religions redirect guilt towards service (e.g. serve your country)
				* Right-wing ideologies sacrifice in terms of protecting one's country/family
				* Left-wing ideologies sacrifice as giving up for the greater good of all society
			* Interpersonal religions alleviate the struggle with the sense that we deserve to be loved
				* Interpersonal religions have rituals and sacrifices designed to make people feel they deserve to be loved (e.g. rings, gifts, anniversaries, wiping the piss off the toilet)
5. Promise Heaven, Deliver Hell
* Human nature is fundamentally designed to generate pain 
	* Human pain is like Whac-A-Mole - every time you known down one kind of pain, another one pops up. Pain may get better or change shape, but it's always there, it is inherent to us
> "Everything is fucked." (pg.104)
	* No country will ever feel completely fair and safe
	* No political philosophy will solve everyone's problems all the time
	* True equality can never be achieved - someone somewhere will always be screwed over
	* No one, no matter how much you love them or they love you, will ever absolve that internal guilt you have simply for existing
	* There is no solution - only incremental improvements, "slightly better forms of fuckedness"
	* This is our fucked-up world, and we're the fucked-up ones in it
6. Prophet for Profit
* No matter who you are, you've adopted some group's beliefs and values. Religious beliefs are a fundamental part of our nature - it is impossible not to adopt them. "We all must have faith in something" - it's how we psychologically survive and thrive, and find hope
* Success is more precarious than failure
> "By experiencing our hopes, we lose them. We see that our beautiful visions for a perfect future are not so perfect, that our dreams and aspirations are themselves riddled with unexpected flaws..." (pg. 106)
*.The only thing that can truly destroy a dream is to have it come true.
