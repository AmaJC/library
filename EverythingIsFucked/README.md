# Everything Is Fucked - Notes

* [Chapter 1](#chapter-1---the-uncomfortable-truth)
* [Chapter 2](#chapter-2---self-control-is-an-illusion)

## Chapter 1 - The Uncomfortable Truth
* The Uncomfortable Truth of Life - one day everyone you love will die, and beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will matter 
* We care and look for meaning and a sense of importance to avoid being crushed by the material insignificance of our existence 
* Hope is our psyche's mental fuel - without hope of a better future, why live?
* The opposite of happiness is NOT anger or sadness - that means you still give a fuck about something. The opposite of happiness is hopelessness - resignation, indifference, "the belief that everything is fucked so why do anything at all" (pg. 16)
* Anxiety, depression, mental issues - the root cause is rooted in hopelessness
* The avoidance of hopelessness, or the construction of hope, is our mind's primary focus
> "Hope narratives are what give our lives a sense of purpose" (pg. 18)
* Religion shields us from the Uncomfortable Truth, much less suicide and depression rates among those of faith 
* This book is an argument against nihilism, to build a case for hope

The Paradox of Progress
* Materially, the modern world is better than it has ever been, yet the Paradox of Progress is that we feel more anxious, desperate, and hopeless the better things get 
* Progress has continued uninterrupted throughout history (e.g. literacy, education, reduced violence, racism, sexism, poverty, diseases, wars, etc)
* US is on an upswing of depression, among adults and younger people
  * Feelings of loneliness and social isolation are up
> "we are the safest and most prosperous humans in the history of the world, yet we are feeling more hopeless than ever before." (pg. 21)
  * Statistics about the past don't inspire hope, hope is based on the future 
  * Hope doesn't care about problems that have already been solved. hope is only concerned about what needs to be solved

To build and maintain hope, we need:
 1. A sense of control
   - Feeling that we can affect our fate
 2. A belief in the value of something
  - Find something worth believing in, working towards, striving for
 3. Community
   - A group that values what we value and is working towards achieving those things 

## Chapter 2 - Self Control is an Illusion
* A man named Elliot had a brain tumor surgery that caused him to lose the ability to feel, while he was still able to think and reason perfectly
* The lost ability to feel caused him to lose the ability to make decisions and control his own life
> "To generate hope in our lives, we must first feel as though we have control over our lives. We must feel as though we’re following through on what we know is good and right; that we’re chasing after “something better.”" (pg. 29)
